# Universal Documentation Auto-Updater

Automates the process of keeping project documentation synchronized with codebase changes. This skill analyzes git differences between the current working branch and the last released version, then intelligently updates relevant documentation files.

## Overview

The Universal Documentation Auto-Updater provides a language-agnostic approach to documentation maintenance. By leveraging git operations to identify what has changed since the last release, it generates targeted updates for README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and project documentation folders.

**Key Features:**

- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any git repository regardless of programming language
- **Dynamic Version Detection**: Automatically finds the latest release tag
- **Comprehensive Diff Analysis**: Analyzes additions, modifications, and deletions
- **Smart Categorization**: Groups changes by type (feature, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)
- **Documentation Discovery**: Automatically finds and updates relevant docs folders

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Preparing documentation for a new release
- The documentation has fallen behind the codebase
- Creating a pull request and need to update docs
- Asked to "update changelog", "update docs", "sync documentation"
- Want to see what changed since the last release
- Need to generate release notes

**Trigger phrases:** "update docs", "update changelog", "sync documentation", "update readme", "prepare release documentation", "what changed since last release", "generate release notes"

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify that the following conditions are met:

```bash
# Verify we're in a git repository
git rev-parse --git-dir

# Check that git tags exist
git tag --list | head -5

# Verify documentation files exist
test -f README.md || echo "README.md not found"
test -f CHANGELOG.md || echo "CHANGELOG.md not found"
```

If no tags exist, inform the user that this skill requires at least one release tag to compare against.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Detect Last Release Version

**Goal**: Identify the latest released version to compare against.

**Actions:**

1. Get the latest tag from the repository:

```bash
# Get the most recent tag
LATEST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null)

# If no tags found, inform the user
if [ -z "$LATEST_TAG" ]; then
    echo "No git tags found. This skill requires at least one release tag."
    echo "Please create a release tag first (e.g., git tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'Initial release')"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Latest release tag: $LATEST_TAG"
echo "Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
```

2. Extract version information for display:

```bash
# Parse version from tag (handles v1.2.3, 1.2.3, release-1.2.3 formats)
VERSION=$(echo "$LATEST_TAG" | sed -E 's/^[^0-9]*([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+).*/\1/')
echo "Version detected: $VERSION"
```

3. Get the current branch name:

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Comparing: $LATEST_TAG -> $CURRENT_BRANCH"
```

### Phase 2: Perform Git Diff Analysis

**Goal**: Analyze all changes between the last release and current branch.

**Actions:**

1. Get the commit range and statistics:

```bash
# Get commit count between tag and HEAD
COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count ${LATEST_TAG}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
echo "Commits since $LATEST_TAG: $COMMIT_COUNT"

# Get file change statistics
git diff --stat ${LATEST_TAG}..HEAD
```

2. Extract commit messages for analysis:

```bash
# Get all commit messages in the range
COMMITS=$(git log ${LATEST_TAG}..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h|%s|%b" --reverse)

# Display commits for review
echo "$COMMITS"
```

3. Get detailed file changes:

```bash
# Get list of changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${LATEST_TAG}..HEAD)

# Categorize changes by type
ADDED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A ${LATEST_TAG}..HEAD)
DELETED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D ${LATEST_TAG}..HEAD)
MODIFIED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=M ${LATEST_TAG}..HEAD)
```

4. Identify component areas based on file paths:

```bash
# Detect which components/areas changed
echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -E "^plugins/" | cut -d'/' -f2 | sort -u
```

### Phase 3: Discover Documentation Structure

**Goal**: Identify all relevant documentation locations in the project.

**Actions:**

1. Find standard documentation folders:

```bash
# Check for common documentation locations
DOC_FOLDERS=()

[ -d "docs" ] && DOC_FOLDERS+=("docs/")
[ -d "documentation" ] && DOC_FOLDERS+=("documentation/")
[ -d "doc" ] && DOC_FOLDERS+=("doc/")

# Find plugin-specific docs
for plugin_dir in plugins/*/; do
    if [ -d "${plugin_dir}docs" ]; then
        DOC_FOLDERS+=("${plugin_dir}docs/")
    fi
done

echo "Documentation folders found:"
printf '  - %s\n' "${DOC_FOLDERS[@]}"
```

2. Identify existing documentation files:

```bash
# Check for standard doc files
DOC_FILES=()

[ -f "README.md" ] && DOC_FILES+=("README.md")
[ -f "CHANGELOG.md" ] && DOC_FILES+=("CHANGELOG.md")
[ -f "CONTRIBUTING.md" ] && DOC_FILES+=("CONTRIBUTING.md")
[ -f "docs/GUIDE.md" ] && DOC_FILES+=("docs/GUIDE.md")

echo "Documentation files found:"
printf '  - %s\n' "${DOC_FILES[@]}"
```

### Phase 4: Generate CHANGELOG Updates

**Goal**: Create categorized changelog entries following Keep a Changelog standard.

**Actions:**

1. Parse commits by conventional commit types and categorize:
- **Added**: New features (feat, feature commits)
- **Changed**: Changes to existing functionality
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes (fix, bug commits)
- **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed**: Features removed in this release
- **Security**: Security vulnerability fixes

2. Read the existing CHANGELOG.md to understand structure, then generate new entries following Keep a Changelog format.

See `references/examples.md` for detailed bash commands and changelog templates.

### Phase 5: Update README.md

**Goal**: Update the main README with relevant high-level changes.

**Actions:**

1. Read the current README.md to understand its structure
2. Identify sections needing updates (features list, skills/agents, setup instructions, version references)
3. Apply updates using Edit tool: preserve structure, maintain tone, update version numbers

### Phase 6: Update Documentation Folders

**Goal**: Propagate changes to relevant documentation in docs/ folders.

**Actions:**

1. For each documentation folder found, check for files referencing changed code
2. Map changed files to their documentation
3. Generate updates: add new feature docs, update API references, fix outdated examples

See `references/examples.md` for detailed discovery patterns and update strategies.

### Phase 7: Present Changes for Review

**Goal**: Show the user what will be updated before applying changes.

**Actions:**

1. Present a summary of proposed changes:

```markdown
## Proposed Documentation Updates

### Version Information
- Previous release: $LATEST_TAG
- Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH
- Commits analyzed: $COMMIT_COUNT

### Files to Update
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md - Add new version section with categorized changes
- [ ] README.md - Update [specific sections]
- [ ] docs/[specific files] - Update documentation

### Summary of Changes
**Added**: N new features
**Changed**: N modifications
**Fixed**: N bug fixes
**Breaking**: N breaking changes
```

2. Ask the user for confirmation via **AskUserQuestion**:

- Confirm which files to update
- Ask if any changes should be modified
- Get approval to proceed

### Phase 8: Apply Documentation Updates

**Goal**: Write the updates to the documentation files.

**Actions:**

1. Update CHANGELOG.md:

```bash
# Read current changelog
CURRENT_CHANGELOG=$(cat CHANGELOG.md)

# Prepend new section
cat > CHANGELOG.md << 'EOF'
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
[New content goes here]

[Rest of existing changelog]
EOF
```

2. Update README.md using Edit tool:

- Make targeted edits to specific sections
- Preserve overall structure
- Update version numbers if applicable

3. Update documentation files:

```bash
# For each documentation file that needs updates
# Use Edit tool to make precise changes
```

4. Show git diff of changes:

```bash
# Show what will change
git diff CHANGELOG.md
git diff README.md
git diff docs/
```

## Examples

- 15 features, 8 fixes, 3 breaking changes detected
- Complete CHANGELOG.md [2.5.0] section generated
- README.md and plugin docs updated

### Example 3: Incremental Sync

**User request:** "Sync docs, I've made some changes"

**Output:**
- 2 commits analyzed
- Focused CHANGELOG update for github-issue-workflow skill changes
- No README or plugin doc updates needed

See `references/examples.md` for detailed session transcripts and troubleshooting.

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify before writing**: Show the user what will change before applying updates
2. **Follow Keep a Changelog**: Maintain consistent changelog formatting
3. **Categorize properly**: Use correct categories (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
4. **Be specific**: Include plugin/component names in changelog entries
5. **Preserve structure**: Maintain existing documentation structure and style
6. **Reference commits**: Include commit hashes for traceability when helpful
7. **Handle breaking changes**: Clearly highlight breaking changes with migration notes
8. **Update version refs**: Keep version numbers consistent across documentation

## Constraints and Warnings

1. **Requires git tags**: This skill only works if the repository has at least one release tag
2. **Read-only analysis**: The skill analyzes changes but asks before writing
3. **Manual review required**: Generated changelog entries should be reviewed for accuracy
4. **Conventional commits**: Works best with projects using conventional commit format
5. **Does not create tags**: This skill updates docs but does not create release tags
6. **No auto-commit**: Documentation changes are prepared but not committed automatically
7. **Project-specific patterns**: Some projects may have custom changelog formats to respect
8. **File paths**: All file paths use forward slashes (Unix style) for cross-platform compatibility
